                <h1>NICE TO MEET YOU!</h1>
                <p>I'm Carina Finucane, a UX/UI designer from Half Moon Bay, California. I taught language to middle and high schoolers in public schools for seven years and have experience designing fun learning experiences for even the most reluctant of audiences. I enjoy making complicated problems simple and learning every step of the way. More recently, I have completed a post master's certificate to get a deeper understanding of user experience design and front-end development as I move into a world that allows me to explore creativity and design in different ways.</p>

                <h1 class="p2">GARDEN</h1>
                <p class="p2">I have a gardening obsession and have tended to a variety of plants. Native and drought-tolerant plants are my go-tos, but I also have a few fruit and citrus trees.</p>

                <h1 class="p2">LANGUAGE & CULTURE</h1>
                <p class="p2">After completing a bachelor's in Spanish and Sociology and a master's in Education, I taught English and Spanish at the middle and high school levels for seven years. I have a fascination with language and how it is used to navigate cultures and social relationships. This interest began with my own experiences being the first child of Mexican immigrants in the United States.</p>

                <p class="p2">My dog is an elderly Boston Terrier, but don't be fooled. She takes me on walks regularly and thinks she's the biggest dog in town. We enjoy hiking dog-friendly trails near the coast.</p>
