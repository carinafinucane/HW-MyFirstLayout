            <h1>NICE TO MEET YOU!</h1>
            <p>I'm Carina Finucane, a UX/UI designer from Half Moon Bay, California. I taught language to middle and
                high schoolers in public schools for seven years and have experience designing fun learning experiences
                for even the most reluctant of audiences. I enjoy making complicated problems simple and learning every
                step of the way. More recently, I have completed a post master's certificate to get a deeper
                understanding of user experience design and front-end development as I move into a world that allows me
                to explore creativity and design in different ways.</p>

        <div class="gridchild aboutgarden">
            <h1 class="p2">GARDEN</h1>
            <p class="p2">I have a gardening obsession and have tended to a variety of plants. Native and
                drought-tolerant plants are my go-tos, but I also have a few fruit and citrus trees.</p>

        <div class="gridchild aboutteaching">
            <h1 class="p2">LANGUAGE & CULTURE</h1>
            <p class="p2">After completing a bachelor's in Spanish and Sociology and master's in Education, I taught
                English and Spanish at the middle and high school levels for seven years. I have a fascination with
                language and how it is used to navigate cultures and social relationships. This interest began with my
                own experiences being the first child of Mexican immigrants in the United States.</p>

        <div class="gridchild aboutdog">
            <h1 class="p2">DOG LADY</h1>
            <p class="p2">My dog is an elderly Boston Terrier, but don't be fooled. She takes me on walks regularly and
                thinks she's the biggest dog in town. We enjoy hiking dog-friendly trails near the coast.</p>
